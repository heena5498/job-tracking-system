📘 Overview
The Job Tracking System (HustleHUB) is a cloud-native web application designed to help users manage, filter, and verify job listings efficiently while minimizing fake or misleading postings.
It leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Scheduler for backend automation — and a Vue.js / Vuetify frontend (Google-themed) for an interactive user experience.

🌐 Key Features
🎯 Core Functionality

- Job Listing & Tracking: Users can browse, filter, and track job applications easily.
- Fake Listing Detection: Filters misleading job postings using internal validation workflows.
- Automated Status Updates: Sends notifications or reminders about job status via Pub/Sub triggers.
- Search & Filtering: Search jobs by title, company, category, or posting date.
- Secure Data Flow: Uses Secret Manager and IAM policies for secure credentials and configuration.

  Service Purpose
  Cloud Scheduler Automates backend triggers to check new job data.
  Cloud Functions (HTTP Trigger) Executes logic to fetch, validate, and store job postings.
  SMTP Server Handles asynchronous messaging between services.
  Firestore Provides real-time sync for frontend components.

  Data Flow Summary:

1. Frontend calls a Cloud Function (HTTP endpoint).
2. Function publishes a message to SMTP Server with new or updated job data.
3. Subscriber function processes and stores the data in Firestore.
4. Cloud Scheduler triggers validation routines at scheduled intervals.
5. Email/Notification Service sends updates to users (via Gmail API / SendGrid / SMTP).

💻 Frontend (Vue + Vuetify)
The web interface is styled in Google Material Design, providing:

- Clean cards for job listings.
- Sidebar filters (e.g., category, location, experience).
- Login and tracking dashboards.
- Responsive design and animations using Vuetify components.
